## Discussion

I chose to use `TensorFlow` because Jason M mentioned over the phone that it is the preferred library.

The 2-layer MLP achieves about ~78% accuracy on the training and validation sets. Which... is... just OK.

### RandomForest

I also tried a RandomForestClassifer (found at the bottom of `zeta.ipynb`).

It differed in its predictions from the MLP on the test set on only the 1st and 13th instances.
